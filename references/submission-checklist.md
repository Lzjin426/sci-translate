# Submission Checklist

Use this checklist before claiming the translation is submission-ready.

## Scientific Accuracy

- Numbers, units, symbols, and equations are unchanged from source.
- Experimental settings and boundary conditions are preserved.
- Claims do not exceed evidence.

## Terminology

- Core terms are translated consistently across all sections.
- Abbreviations are defined at first mention.
- Domain-specific terms follow target journal/community conventions.

## Language Quality

- Sentences are concise and unambiguous.
- Tense usage is consistent by section (methods past; facts present).
- Grammar and punctuation are clean.
- Transitional phrases are not overused in a repetitive template pattern.
- Sentence length and cadence are not mechanically uniform.

## Tense Audit

- General facts, definitions, and method principles use present tense.
- Prior studies with specific authors/citations use past tense for completed actions.
- Field-wide trend summaries (without a single concrete study) may use present perfect.
- In Methods, use present tense for framework/procedure description; use past tense for completed run settings when needed.
- In Results, use past tense for observed outcomes and measured values.
- In Results/Discussion, use present tense for interpretation, implications, and generalizable claims.
- Figure/table references use present tense (e.g., "Fig. 3 shows...").
- Future work uses future tense.
- Verb strength matches evidence strength (`suggest/indicate` < `show/demonstrate` < `confirm/validate`).
- Avoid tense drift inside one sentence unless the shift clearly separates observation vs interpretation.

## Academic Tone

- Wording is objective, neutral, and evidence-based.
- Overclaiming and promotional phrases are removed.
- Limitations and uncertainty are retained where needed.

## Structure

- Abstract follows background-method-result-conclusion logic.
- Results and discussion are not mixed excessively.
- Figure/table captions match symbols and units in main text.

## Final Risk Scan

- Mark any ambiguous Chinese source sentence for author confirmation.
- Mark any term without confident domain mapping.
- Mark any sentence where multiple valid translations exist.
- Mark any paragraph that still sounds formulaic or "AI-like" after polishing.

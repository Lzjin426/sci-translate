# Submission Checklist

Use this checklist before claiming the translation is submission-ready.

## Scientific Accuracy

- Numbers, units, symbols, and equations are unchanged from source.
- Experimental settings and boundary conditions are preserved.
- Claims do not exceed evidence.

## Terminology

- Core terms are translated consistently across all sections.
- Abbreviations are defined at first mention.
- Domain-specific terms follow target journal/community conventions.

## Language Quality

- Sentences are concise and unambiguous.
- Tense usage is consistent by section (methods past; facts present).
- Grammar and punctuation are clean.
- Transitional phrases are not overused in a repetitive template pattern.
- Sentence length and cadence are not mechanically uniform.

## Academic Tone

- Wording is objective, neutral, and evidence-based.
- Overclaiming and promotional phrases are removed.
- Limitations and uncertainty are retained where needed.

## Structure

- Abstract follows background-method-result-conclusion logic.
- Results and discussion are not mixed excessively.
- Figure/table captions match symbols and units in main text.

## Final Risk Scan

- Mark any ambiguous Chinese source sentence for author confirmation.
- Mark any term without confident domain mapping.
- Mark any sentence where multiple valid translations exist.
- Mark any paragraph that still sounds formulaic or "AI-like" after polishing.
